<p align = "left"><font color ="black" face = "verdana"><img src = "grid.jpeg" align ="left"><h2>Did you know?</h2><h3>Filipino cuisine</h3> (Filipino: Lutuing Pilipino/Pagkaing Pilipino) is composed of the cuisines of more than a hundred distinct ethno-linguistic groups found throughout the Philippine archipelago. 
However, a majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are <img src = "food1.jpeg" align ="left">from the cuisines of the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog, Bicolano, Visayan (Cebuano, Hiligaynon and Waray), Chavacano and Maranao ethno-linguistic groups.
<p><font color ="black" face = "verdana">During the pre-Hispanic era in the Philippines, the preferred Austronesian methods for food preparation were boiling, steaming and roasting. The ingredients for common dishes were obtained from locally raised livestock.
These ranged from kalabaw (waterbuffaloes/carabaos), baka (cows), manok (chickens) and baboy (pigs) to various kinds of fish and seafood. In 3200 BCE, Austronesians from the southern China (Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau) and Taiwan settled in the region that is now called the Philippines. They brought with them knowledge of rice cultivation and other farming practices which increased the number and variety of edible dish ingredients available for cooking.
